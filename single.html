                            Succulents are a popular choice with home gardeners for two simple reasons: They're beautiful to look and nearly indestructible.
                        </p> 
                        <p class="fs-5 ">
                            To get technical, a succulent is any plant with thick, fleshy (succulent) water storage organs. Succulents store water in their leaves, stems, or roots. They've adapted to survive arid conditions found throughout the world, from Africa (where many of them are native to) to the deserts of North America. This adaptive mechanism has resulted in an incredible variety of interesting leaf forms and plant shapes, including paddle leaves, tight rosettes, and bushy or trailing columns of teardrop leaves. As a group, succulents include some of the most well-known plants, such as the aloe and agave plants, as well as many nearly-unknown varietals found only in their natural environment. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 ">
                            In addition, cacti are a unique subset of the succulent group and feature their own individual care and appearance. No matter what kind of succulent you're growing, the rules are pretty similar among the different species. Here are the general rules for growing top-quality succulents.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-3">Light</p>
                        <p class="fs-5">Succulents prefer bright light when kept indoors or out, and should get at least six hours of sunlight a day. You can watch their leaves for an indication that the light exposure level you're giving them is correct—some species will scorch if suddenly exposed to too much direct sunlight, while others will have leaves that turn brown or white as the plant bleaches out and the soft tissues are destroyed.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5">On the other hand, an under-exposed succulent will begin to stretch, with an elongated stem and widely spaced leaves in a condition known as etiolation. The solution to this issue is to provide the plant with a better light source and prune the plant back to its original shape.</p>
